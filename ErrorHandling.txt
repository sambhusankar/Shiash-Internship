Task no 8
There are many more errors in python here are some of them.

1. Syntax Error -
    This error occurs when the programer writes the wrong syntaxes. Every programming language have different 
    different syntaxes we need to follow the syntax rules while writing code.
    
    Ex :-
        print("Software Engineering

    (closing bracket and double quote missing)

2. Zero Divison Error -
    This error occurs when the programmer tries to devide a number with 0.
    
    Ex :-
        a = 8
        b = 0
        print(a / b)

    (we can not devide a number with zero)

3. Value Error - 
    This error occurs when the programmer tries to do operations with different different datatypes.

    Ex :-
        a = "engineering"
        b = 6
        print(a + b)

    (tries add a string datatype with int datatypes which is impossible)

4. Index Error - 
    This error occurs when the porgrammer tries to acces a index of a iterable datatype and the index
    is out of the data.

    Ex :-
        list = [ "sankar", "shiv", "bholenath", "mahadev", "sambhu", "mahakal"]
        print(list[9])

    (Tries to access the 9th index of data which is not available in the list)

5. Indention Error - 
    This error occurs when the prgrammer don't write the codes with correcct indention.

    Ex :-
        a = "software "
        b = "engineering"
          c= a + b
        print(c)

    (Here the third line is not in correct indention it will through a indention error)
